          that’s unwavering and unconditional. No matter where we stay, I always
          know you are the one I can always count on. So, a big thank you to you
          for being my bosom Pilla for life!🐼🥺

          I was never considered an easygoing person and everyone knows that im boring person,😭
          but you proved everybodywrong. You stayed with me and managed to stick around when others
          could have simply left. You made me feel happy . I can’t tell you
          how blessed I feel to be around you. Thank you for everything, my panda🐼🥺

          You have taught me so much and always wished the best for me. You are
          one of the biggest reasons I could take care of myself and my health
          I must have done some good deeds in my previous life because,
          in this one, I have found a gem like you.

          A Female friend is a treasure that is hard to find. But I so am glad I
          found you! I’m blessed to have you as my panda. Thank you for always
          being there when nobody else was. I love you so much that words can
          never express the actual depth of my feelings. You are a herald of
          good fortune for me. Since we met, my life has changed for the better.
          You are my special panda, and no matter what, I will never let you go.❤️

          you are my everything,🐼
          I just want to let you know I am thinking about you and you are always in my heart 
          I miss you when something good happens to me, and you aren’t there to
          share the moment.🥺I miss when someone misunderstands me because you
          are the one who understands me the most. I miss you when I cry or
          laugh because you always comforts me and make me laugh even more. I miss
          you always, but I miss you the most when I am alone, and I think about
          all the times we have spent with one another because I cherish those
          comforting memories always and forever in my heart.

          the luckiest person on the whole freaking planet...
         I wouldn’t have it any other way because a Girl
          like you is a rare diamond I dearly value. Love you Panda. Words just
          can’t describe how much you mean to me.
